#### [127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/word-ladder/) <span style="color:red">Hard</span>

BFS, Shortest path 

Every word in the word list can be considered as a node, whose possible transformations in the word list can be taken as neighbors. The difference is that this time neighbors need to be found by a certain rule.

``` python
class Solution:

        wordList = set(wordList)

##### 3. State Compression Dynamic Programming (DP)**

TIme Complexity: $O(2^n*n)$

Say the salesman start from 1 and arrives at 4 and along the way we pass by 2 and 3, so he has the routes below:

1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 or 1 --> 3 --> 2 --> 4

If start and end are fixed, the path that has a lower cost is the best route for now and  it can be taken as the locally optimal solution. The process could repeat itself until the end. The problem now is converted into a combination problem.

$dp[start, b, c, ... , end][end]$ This matrix stored the min cost when the salesman start and then pass by b, c... and arrives at end.

examples: 

$dp[1, 2][2] = dp[1, 1] + costs[1][2]$: the lowest cost from 1 to 2 is the lowest cost from 1 to 1 plus the cost from 1 to 2

$dp[1,2,3,4][4] = min(dp[1, 2, 3][3] + costs[3][4] , dp[1,2,3][2] + costs[2][4])$ :  

- 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 the cost starting from 1, passing by 2 and 3, arriving at 3 plus the cost from 3 to 4
- 1 --> 3 --> 2 -- >4 the cost starting from 1, passing by 2 and 3, arriving at 2 (i. e. from 3 to 2) plus the cost from 2 to 4

But an array can not be used as indexing so it is represented by a sequence of binary numbers. For example, 1 --> 3 --> 5 is 10101 and $2^0 + 2^2 + 2^4 = 21$.  

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, n, roads):
        # costs[a][b] means how much is the cost going from a to b
        costs = self.build_graph(roads, n)

        dp = [
            [float('inf')] * (n + 1)   # n + 1 possible ends (first city is 1 not 0 so here is n + 1 instead of n)
            for _ in range(routes_count) # 2 ^ n - 1 possible routes
        ]
        dp[1][1] = 0
        for route in range(routes_count):
            # start is fixed as 1 so at least the salesman arrives at 2
            for end in range(2, n + 1):
                compressed_end = 1 << (end - 1)
                # AND: only both
                # skip if end is not in the route
                if route & compressed_end == 0:
                    continue
                # XOR: either one but not both
                # remove end from the route 
                previous_route = route ^ compressed_end
                for last_passed in range(1, n + 1):
                    compressed_last_passed = 1 << (last_passed - 1)
                    # skip if l
                    if previous_route & compressed_last_passed == 0:
                        continue
                    dp[route][end] = min(dp[route][end], dp[previous_route][last_passed] + costs[last_passed][end])
        return min(dp[routes_count - 1])

            graph[city_from] = {}
            for city_to in range(1, cities_count + 1):
                graph[city_from][city_to] = float("inf")
        
        # assign real costs
        for city_a, city_b, cost in roads:
            graph[city_a][city_b] = min(graph[city_a][city_b], cost)
            graph[city_b][city_a] = min(graph[city_b][city_a], cost)

another way of doing dfs, but this method will fail due to TLE. It runs too slow even after pruning.
